Remember how everything was great in v1.1 and then you renamed a class in v1.2 and all your users complained about the breaking change? Luddite is here to prevent all the changes by breaking your build ğŸ˜…! 

Luddite is a Github bot and gradle plugin based on [japicmp](https://github.com/siom79/japicmp) that will tell you the potentially breaking API and ABI changes on each pull request.
